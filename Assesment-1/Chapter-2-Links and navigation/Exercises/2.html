    <br><h3><u>Game Review</u></h3>
    <p>"I enjoyed Deltarune Chapter 1 immensely.
         Although I wasn't too impressed by the story, the foreshadowing, 
         characters, and foundation of the overarching plot has me intrigued to 
         see where Fox and Co. go next. I full-heartedly encourage everyone and 
         anyone to pick up the game." -<i> Yoon L. , Arts & Entertainment Editor on TATLER. </i></p>

         <br><p> "While it certainly isn’t the greatest game of all time as some may 
            have had you believe, it definitely satisfies the entertainment 
            factor through dry humor, outlandish plot twists, a powerful 
            soundtrack, and emotionally-intense characters."-<i> Mitchell Parton on NintendoWorldReport.</i></p>
