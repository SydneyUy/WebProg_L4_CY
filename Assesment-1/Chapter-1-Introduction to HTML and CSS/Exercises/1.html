<ol>
    <li>Prepare the saba banana by peeling and cutting into even slices about three millimeters thick. Three ripe bananas will give you about 12 pieces total. </li><br>
    <li>Prep your workstation by putting the dark brown sugar and water on seperate bowls and pre-peel the individual spring roll wrappers</li><br>
    <p>Rolling Tecnique</p>
    <li> Place a spring roll wrapper in a diamond shape in front of you. Take one banana slice and coat it lightly with the brown sugar, and roll upwards.  Continue to roll upwards until you have one inch left of space. Use your fingers to brush the top corner with water and complete the roll to seal. Repeat with the rest of the turon.</li><br>
    <li>In a pan, fill it with oli and set in medium heat or 350 <sup>Â°F</sup>. </li>
    <li>Once it is hot enough, lower the rolls into the oli and deep fry until golden brown. Remove the turon and place them onto a wire rack. Repeat with the rest of the turon. </li><br>
    <p>Brown sugar sauce</p>
    <li>After all the rolls are fried, use the same pan and directly add brown sugar. Use a spatula to move the melted sugar around and continue to cook for about one to two minutes or until the sugar is light golden brown. Remove the pan from the heat immediately.</li><br>
    <li> use tongs to dip and roll the turon right into the caramel pan. Be careful when dipping because the caramel can be very hot.
        Let the turon rest for about one minute. The caramel should harden and it should be ready to serve!</li><br>
