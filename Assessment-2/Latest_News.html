         <h1>Notice: Temporary Closure of Rare Books Section</h1> 
         <h2>Published: April 22, 2025</h2>
         <p>Due to a recent containment issue, 
            the Rare Books section will be temporarily closed to the public effective immediately. 
            During a routine archival inspection, staff identified unusual signs of degradation 
            among several historically significant volumes. Investigation has found that the cause was from rodents, breaking in.</p>
        <p>While the affected materials have been isolated and there is no 
            immediate threat to visitor safety, we are proceeding with deep preservation cleaning and environmental 
            recalibration of the archives.</p>
        <p>Please note:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All access to the Rare Books catalog has been suspended until further notice.</li>
            <li>Researchers with scheduled appointments will be contacted individually.</li>
            <li>Restoration is expected to take 1–2 weeks, pending results from external bioassay testing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We appreciate your understanding and 
            patience as we work to protect these irreplaceable collections.</p>

            <h1>Cognitive Enhancement & Human Integration Trial</h1> 
            <h2>Published: April 15, 2025</h2>
            <p>Collins Library is proud to support a groundbreaking research initiative 
                in partnership with the Neuropath Research Institute. This joint venture, titled “Cognitive Enhancement & Human Integration Trial 
                (CEHIT)”, aims to break the bounderies of human evolution, in thier cognitive and physicality.</p>
   
           <p>Over the course of 2 months, registered and approved participants will engage in testing by researchers, including our head, Layan Tremblay. 
            These sessions are facilitated through select archival materials.</p>
           <p>Objectives:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>Enhance human information processing capacity.</li>
               <li>Improve strength, adaptation and constitution.</li>
               <li>Study the Human cognitive and test genetic engineering.</li>
           </ul>
           <p>Participants are monitored closely for changes in comprehension, body, 
            and behavioral expression.
            Community members are invited to learn more during our public information session on May 4, 
            2025 at 6:30 PM, hosted in the Main Auditorium. Light refreshments and informational pamphlets 
            will be provided.
